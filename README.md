# FDLReverb
A Wwise Plugin convolutional reverb.
It's basicly a simplified convolutional reverb which can select IR data by typing in the name of 'sound sfx' in wwise editor.(thanks to [Imawak](https://github.com/Imawak))

TODO:
1. Up or down sampling function and drag to substitude IR function.
2. Dry data not delayed when input data not enough, but wet data delayed, and it will cause the delay time between wet and dry sound increasing.
